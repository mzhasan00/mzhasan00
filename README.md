### Summary  
AI Engineer with a strong grasp of modern AI concepts and technologies including LLM, RAG, AI Agents, RLHF, and prompt engineering.   
I have a solid understanding of major neural network architectures (Transformers, Diffusion models, CNNs, GANs, RNNs, and LSTMs),   
can implement them in PyTorch, and can customize them to meet problem needs. I am proficient in Python and its ecosystem including   
PyTorch, LangChain, LlamaIndex, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Django. I am also comfortable with JavaScript and its   
ecosystem for web and desktop app development.

### Work Experience
**AI Research Engineer**  
AIMS Lab, United International University | July 2025 - Present    
My research focus is the application of AI in Healthcare. I do experimental research on NLP with a focus on the Bengali language and 
Healthcare applications. I also write scientific papers and manage research projects.

**AI Data Engineer**  
Outlier | July 2024 - June 2025  
I was an Independent Contractor at Outlier AI. Contributed to the development of datasets for training large code models, with a focus on 
JavaScript and Python.

**Competition Expert**  
Kaggle | May 2023 - June 2024  
Earned two bronze medals in "CAFA 5 Protein Function Prediction" and "NeurIPS 2024 - Predict New Medicines with BELKA," attaining   
Competition Expert status.Showcased my ability in tackling complex real-world problems.

**Business Analyst Intern**  
Tork | February 2023 - April 2023  
Supported the branding and marketing team with data-driven insights. Applied analytical skills to guide strategic decisions in a real-world 
business environment.

### Projects
**BNID – Balanced Network for Imbalanced Data**  
Designed a new neural network architecture that tackles data imbalance not through augmentation, but by making the architecture itself 
inherently robust to imbalance.
  
**Aitist – AI Model for SVG-Based Image Generation**  
Building a language-to-code model that generates SVG images from natural language instructions. The goal is to power a new kind of digital 
canvas where designers describe ideas in words, and AI handles the visuals.  

**Protein Function Prediction from Amino Acid Sequences**  
Developed a deep learning-based model to predict biological functions of proteins from raw amino acid sequences using neural networks.

### Education
