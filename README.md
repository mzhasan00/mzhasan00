### Summary  
AI Engineer with a strong grasp of modern AI concepts including LLM Finetuning (SFT, LoRA, QLoRA, RLHF, DPO) and AI Agent Development. Have a solid understanding of major neural network architectures (Transformers, Diffusion models, CNNs, GANs, RNNs,  LSTMs etc.), can implement them in PyTorch and can customize to meet problem needs. Proficient in Python and its ecosystem including PyTorch, LangChain, LlamaIndex, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, FastAPI. Passionate about implementing cutting-edge AI research from scratch. My technical focus is centered on task-specific LLM fine-tuning, semi-autonomous agentic systems, and optimizing model alignment through Human-in-the-Loop data generation.

<!-- 
### Work Experience
**Advanced AI Trainer**  
Invisible Technologies |  July 2025 - Present    
At Invisible I am currently focused on LLM finetuning, where I manage a portfolio of high-impact projects. These include a primary   
initiative in MCP-based tool calling, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and the specialized training of reasoning models.  
  
**AI Research Engineer**  
AIMS Lab, United International University | January 2025 - June 2025    
My focus of research was the application of AI in Healthcare. I have worked on building methodologies to detect neurodevelopment disorder   
of children from parent-AI conversation.  
  
**AI Data Engineer**  
Outlier | February 2024 - January 2025  
I was an Independent Contractor at Outlier AI. Contributed to the development of datasets for training large code models, with a focus on 
JavaScript and Python.

**Competition Expert**  
Kaggle | May 2023 - January 2024  
Earned two bronze medals in "CAFA 5 Protein Function Prediction" and "NeurIPS 2024 - Predict New Medicines with BELKA," attaining   
Competition Expert status.Showcased my ability in tackling complex real-world problems.

**Business Analyst Intern**  
Tork | February 2023 - April 2023  
Supported the branding and marketing team with data-driven insights. Applied analytical skills to guide strategic decisions in a real-world 
business environment.

### Projects
**BNID – Balanced Network for Imbalanced Data**  
Designed a new neural network architecture that tackles data imbalance not through augmentation, but by making the architecture itself 
inherently robust to imbalance.
  
**Aitist – AI Model for SVG-Based Image Generation**  
Building a language-to-code model that generates SVG images from natural language instructions. The goal is to power a new kind of digital 
canvas where designers describe ideas in words, and AI handles the visuals.  

**Protein Function Prediction from Amino Acid Sequences**  
Developed a deep learning-based model to predict biological functions of proteins from raw amino acid sequences using neural networks.

### Education
**Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering**  
CUET | February 2020 - January 2025  
CGPA: 3.76/4.00  
  
**Micro BSc in Computer Science**  
Phitron | February 2022 - February 2023  
CGPA: 4.00/4.00
